Sample Simplex Menus
--------------------


Here are some sample Simplex menus which should help you to build your
own.  They demonstrate the use of the privilege levels of menu options 
to limit access to certain features.  In our sample, the following
privilege levels are in effect:

  New user --------- 1
  Confirmed user --- 100
  Sysop ------------ 200

The basic precept is that a new user can look at screens and
information files, can yell for the Sysop, can change his/her
configuration, but cannot access file or message areas.

A normal user can access message areas (except for the Sysop's message
area) and can access file areas, including one entitled "Files for
Sysop's Eyes Only" where he/she may upload files, but cannot see the
contents of the file area, nor download anything from there.  The
normal user cannot do a Raw Directory, Move Files, or Kill Files in any
file area either.

The Sysop, of course, has access to everything, including his/her
passworded (second line of protection) message area (the password is
"password").  The Sysop also has the capability of generating file
requests in the Fidonet mail area (for a system which is on the
network).

The structure of the menus presented here are as follows:


     +----------------+----- main.mnu ----+---------------+
     |                |                   |               |    
 msgarea.mnu      change.mnu           info.mnu      filearea.mnu
     |                                                    |
     +-- ad.mnu                               files.mnu --+
     |                                                    |
     +-- msgsysop.mnu                         sysop.mnu --+
     |                                                    |
     +-- msgfido.mnu                                      |
     |                                                    |
     +-- msglocal.mnu                                     |
     |                                                    |
     +-------------------- fattach.mnu -------------------+

and each menu can call logoff.mnu.

These menus require the following message areas:

  1.  Messages to the Sysop  -- Local area -- Private messages only
  2.  Local Messages ---------- Local Area -- Public/Private messages
  3.  Local Fileattach -------- Fileattach -- Private messages only
  4.  Fidonet Mail ------------ Netmail ----- Public/Private messages

and the following file areas:

  1.  General File Area  ------ Access priv level 100
  2.  Files for Sysop's Eyes -- Access priv level 200

You should acquire a familiarity with the use of the various menu
options described in SIMPLEX.DOC before you look at the menus.  Each
one has been set up to call the others as diagrammed above.  Notice the
use of the actual view priv levels to keep users out of options that
they are not allowed to access!  For example, a user below 100 will
neither see the option to go to the file areas nor be able to access
it.  This means that options in the file area menu do not all have to
be set to priv level 100, but can remain at level 0.  Why?  Well, it
saves you a lot of trouble if you decide later to make level 50 access
file areas.  Only place you will have to change will be the option on
the main menu, giving people with a level of 50 or higher the option to
get to the file areas.  Since folks cannot get there in any other way,
the file area menus are safe being left with view privilege level 0.
