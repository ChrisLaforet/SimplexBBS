Simplex BBS:
(s4t0b8V
Simplex is a single-user BBS package that makes it easy for someone to start their own BBS or host system.  Simplex is simple
to configure, and a cinch to maintain.  It supports Fidonet mail completely (Simplex is a registered Fidonet application).

Simplex supports up to 9,999 file areas and 9,999 message areas.  Menus are completely configurable by the Sysop.  QWK-
compatible offline readers are fully supported.

Simplex has been in active use on systems around the world for over two years.  It has proven to be a very robust and dependable
package.  Companies have purchased its source code to use Simplex as a stable platform for their communciations.  Simplex's
structures are public domain so that software authors can develop utilities to supplement Simplex as a BBS.

Since Simplex is free, it is available for download from the BBSes listed below or from Compuserve's IBMBBS forum.

Multiplex BBS:
(s4t0b8V
Multiplex contains all of the features of Simplex.  It is a multi-user BBS package that utilizes a client-server architecture based
on named-pipes.  This permits nodes to be scattered over a network, if necessary.  Multiplex is currently under development
and testing.  Targeted release date is sometime during first quarter of 1993.

The message-passing architecture will be public domain (as are Simplex's structures) to encourage the development of utilities
and alternate client processes (for example, an X.25 interface).  You may call the number below for more information on Multiplex.

Source Code:
(s4t0b8V
One of the strengths of Simplex is the availablity of source code.  Multiplex will also have this desirable trait.  Sysops who wish
to customize their BBS package, incorporate new features, or who simply want to have the code so they can fix problems that
might crop up, can easily order the code.  Companies developing communications platforms can negotiate with Chris Laforet
Software for reasonable royalty agreements.

Cost:
(s4t0b8V
Simplex is available free of charge for individuals and for companies.  Multiplex is targeted to sell between $350 and $400 for an
unlimited node license.  Simplex's source code is available for $175 with a signed license form.  Multiplex's source code is
targeted to be sold between $400 and $500.
