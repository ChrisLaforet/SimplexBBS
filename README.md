# Simplex BBS Source

In a wave of nostagic memories of the heyday of BBSes like my The Programmer's Oasis, I decided to find and post the source for historical purposes.  I 
was actually surprised to see that someone had actually built out an OS/2 machine last year (2023) and installed Simplex/2!  The nostagia was triggered
by the Jason Scott documentary ("BBS: The Documentary") on YouTube https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7nj3G6Jpv2G6Gp6NvN1kUtQuW8QshBWE&si=iFhXUBjvnzyJZWW0.

Anyway, here it is in all of its raw Microsoft C glory for what it is worth.  If you do find some use for it, drop me a line.  I would love to hear about it!
