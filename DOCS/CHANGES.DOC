          This document provides a listing of all of the major changes
          accomplished between versions of Simplex.  It is handy as a quick
          reference to what is new or changed with a new release.


          Version 1.00:  Released Jan 3, 1991.  This was the first non-beta
                         version of Simplex.  Events are not completed.
                         ANSI editor can have some additional features
                         added.  External protocols are not yet
                         implemented.

          Version 1.01:  Released Feb 24, 1991.  The following things were
                         modified or added:

             - Linted and cleaned up code.
             - Added logic to put commas in displays of numbers (as in
               1,009,198).
             - Squashed bug in Ymodem and Ymodem-G send which wasted file-
               handles by reopening the file to send each time it send SOH!
             - Fixed the problem when adding a new message area, causing
               false message counts for that area instead of a count of 0.
             - Added logic for handling logins of deleted users.
             - Added logic for re-entering names if hitting enter on
               password 3 times in a row.
             - Cleaned up s_start.c to stop initializing and deintializing
               fossil each time it went out to reinitialize the modem.
             - Cleaned up OS/2 fossil threads to exit upon deinitialization
               of fossil.
             - Started work on the MultiChat version of OS/2.
             - Fixed problem that allowed echomail-barred users to reply to
               echomail messages!  Now if user doesn't have a level >=
               write_level for the echo, they cannot reply.
             - Added option that users with a level >= sysop_level for an
               echomail area can now send echomail addressed to "Sysop".
               Other users cannot enter mail to sysop in an echomail area.
             - Added new options, uptime, downtime, change priv.
             - Allow zone to go up to 99.
             - Smailfix now has a new option -date to delete messages with
               a date greater than today's date.
             - SMC and Config were modified to support the new menu options
               in Simplex.

             The only known bug at this point is that Simplex Zmodem
               download will occassionally hang when garbage characters are
               coming in on the back channel and it requests a ZACK from
               the receiver.

               entered flags.
             - Added $k option to external shell which allows a user's time
               to be kept untouched while he/she is out of Simplex (i.e.
               time is not recalculated upon reentry).
             - Added logic to check for events after returning from
               external shell.
             - Expanded file-list buffer from 150 to 256 characters.

             - Fixed problem where a user couldn't quote messages with
               Ctrl-A kludge in s_full.c (ANSI editor).
             - Installed menu template types in s_menu.c
             - Fixed problem with logging in if there are no message areas.
               This was due to calling message-handling functions which had
               no checks for message file existence.
             - Fixed bug in filename search routines to correctly handle
               wildcards.
             - Added S flag for DOS startup which prevents Simplex from
               closing the
                stdout (console writes) handle and reopening it to the NUL
               device (to prevent fossils like X00 from messing up the
               screen!).
             - Added new menu item: Replace Current Menu.
             - Added new menu item: Show Quote from file.
             - Added downloadable combination mail.
             - Shorted timeouts in Zmodem.
             - Corrected bug in ansi editor.  User could insert a blank
               line and arrow over a few spaces and start typing -- this
               would cause the contents of the previous line to spill out
               of the end of the current line as if they were being pushed
               by the insertion of the new text!
             - Sped up filename and keyword searches across file areas.
               Fixed minor bugs in keyword search code.
             - Cleaned up OS/2 FOSSIL startup.
             - Cleaned up Zmodem and Ymodem-G along with protocol-sends
               under OS/2.
             - Set up netmail to handle routed and hold-for-pickup mail
               options.
             - Added -D flag which allows Simplex to start up with a data
               file containing a user's information.
             - Added quiet flags to SPACK and SCLEAN.
             - SMP: Stopped echomail with INTL addresses from being sent to
               their origins by comparing INTL-net and INTL-node with
               header destination net/node.  If no match, the message is
               sent to header net/node else it is sent to INTL location.
             - SMP: Corrected problem in preliminary routing where "ALL"
               destinations were not matched and acted upon.
             - SMP: Changed routing verbs to match new Simplex mail
               philosophy.
             - SMAIL: Corrected message headers for echomail to include
               current node's address when forwarding mail.
             - SMAIL: Improved resynchronizing algorithm while unpacking
               packets.
             - SMAIL: Corrected problem that prevented grunged packets from
               being deleted.
             - CONFIG: Set up Path seperators as macros to aid portability.
             - CONFIG: Fixed minor problem with deleting user.
             - CONFIG: Corrected problem with net-credit field.

             Known bugs at this point:

               toggle the change flag.
             - Fixed problem which limited zone address to < 10.
             - Corrected zone extension calculations for outbound areas in
               different
                zones.
             - Strip Ctrl-Z's when showing ans/asc files or files.bbs.

             - Corrected bug in downloadable mail which did not trap
               RESTRICTED messages.
             - Corrected DORINFO1.DEF file to include 0 or 1 if fossil is
               present and
                corrected com port value in DOS to be com1 not com0!
             - Simplex now shows the hotkey pressed at a menu IF it is
               pressed after the menu has painted.
             - Added new menu option - show ansi/ascii screens with hotkeys
               only if expert mode is off.

               next downloader would append choices to the previous user's
               list.
             - Fixed kill files to take a list and delete all of them.
               Also asks for confirmation before the final deletion
               operation.
             - After reading Ray Gwinn's docs, changed initialization of
               com port to attempt to use the 0x1c/0x1d pair rather than
               the 0x4/0x5 pair of int 14h calls.  He indicated that after
               July 1991, he was not going to support the 0x4/0x5
               interface.
             - I *think* I found the problem that was blowing the DOS
               version of Simplex!  It was initializing the timer-tick
               parameters using fossil call 0x7 when starting the timer-
               interrupt routine.  Problem with this is that there might
               not have been a fossil, or it was not initialized!  i.e.
               timer was started BEFORE the fossil was initialized.  Now I
               just hard-code the standard PC constants (18.2 ticks/sec).
             - Added logic to boot user off when out of disk space to write
               to log file. Simplex provides a message and then hangs up
               and exits with errorlevel 1.
             - Added the ability to prompt for complete (252 character)
               descriptions for uploaded files.
             - Zmodem, Ymodem and Ymodem-G uploads now correctly timestamp
               the uploaded files with the date contained in the header
               information (as long as it IS sent in the header, otherwise
               the date is left alone).
             - Fixed problem with Restricted Urgent User Messages not being
               readable by most users!
             - Downloads now permit users to auto hangup after d/l is
               complete.
             - Downloads now permit tagging and management of tagged files.
             - Added menu option for reverse filelisting option.
             - Added menu option for Sysop Alert Tone option.
             - Added logoff notification tune (Alt-L).
             - Added event handling to Simplex (finally!).
             - Added the ability to cross-area download.
             - Corrected bug in routine that allows users to change phone
               numbers online.
             - Corrected bug in qwk mail that was causing some indicies to
               remain undeleted.
             - Speeded up OS/2 version with the assistance of Watcom's
               profiler.
             - Corrected bug in QWK importing where a destination name of
               "sysop" was not xlated to the sysop's name.
             - Provided cross-area download searching option for Xmodem and
               Xmodem-1K.
             - Fixed file requests to handle passworded files.
             - Fixed file requests to generate Crash message to Sysop of
               recipient BBS.
             - Corrected bug that prevented TOOSLOW.ASC from being shown to
               callers below minimum baud rate.
