                                Basic Mail Utilities                                Basic Mail Utilities


          This chapter describes all of the basic external mail utilities
          for Simplex.  These utilities are basically of two types,
          utilities to maintain Simplex's message base, and utilities to
          handle incoming and outgoing Net mail.

          Simplex's message base is contained in a series of files
          contained in the Simplex root directory.  The message filenames
          are described in the accompanying SIMPLEX.DOC file.



                     2.1  SCLEAN: Simplex Mail Cleaning Utility                     2.1  SCLEAN: Simplex Mail Cleaning Utility


          SCLEAN.EXE (or SCLEAN2.EXE for OS/2) is a message base
          maintenance program which cleans out messages from message
          boards.  Messages can be cleaned out completely from message
          boards, deleted if received, or deleted if older than a specified
          number of days.  SCLEAN has the following options:

                  -q      Quiet....do not show message by message activity
                  -dxx    Sets maximum days for message killing to xx
                  -nxx    Sets maximum number of messages to keep on boards
          to xx
                  -knxx   Kill messages on board #xx keeping maximum number
          in area
                  -kaxx   Kill ALL messages on board #xx
                  -kdxx   Kill messages prior to maximum days on board #xx
                  -krxx   Kill all received messages on board #xx

          The quiet flag can be used to speed up SCLEAN considerably on
          slow machines.

          SCLEAN can be used to kill messages older than 10 days on message
          boards 1, 7 and 12 and kill all received messages on board 8 with
          the following command line:

                  sclean -d10 -kd1 -kd7 -kd12 -kr8

          The -ka option will normally be used to remove a defunct message
          board's messages from the message base.  Notice that SCLEAN
          merely deletes messages and does not actually remove them from
          the message base.



                      2.2  SPACK: Simplex Message Base Deletion                      2.2  SPACK: Simplex Message Base Deletion


          SPACK.EXE (or SPACK2.EXE for OS/2) is a message base compression
          program.  It will analyse the message base and determine how many
          messages have been deleted, then check file space prior to
          packing.  Packing may optionally be done in-place instead of in
          duplicate files if disk space is at a premium, however this
          method is frowned upon since it might be dangerous should a power
          failure occur.

          SPACK has the following command line options:

                  -q      Quiet....do not show message activity
                  -k      Kill unreasonably sized messages (>100K each)
                  -p      Pack message base
                  -w      Write message base files in place

          The quiet flag will speed up SPACK considerably and should be
          used on slow machines!

          In order to pack the message base, use the following command
          line:

                  spack -p

          Notice: While SPACK runs, if it finds messages larger than 100K,
          it will automatically delete them under the presumption that if a
          message is that large, it is most likely a corruption of the
          message base.

          SLINK.EXE (or SLINK2.EXE for OS/2) is a message base thread
          linker program which will link messages by topic by message
          board.  What SLINK loads all the message topics for a board,
          removes all RE's from the topic lines, then links matching
          message topics into threads.

          By default, SLINK links ALL message boards, however if a file
          called SLINK.BBS is located in the root Simplex directory, only

          the board numbers contained in that file are linked (SLINK.BBS is
          a series of 16-bit ints with each board number to link).  This
          file is generally created by SMAIL when it is importing Net mail
          so that SLINK would not waste time uselessly relinking boards
          that were not imported.

          There are no options to SLINK.  To run it, merely type SLINK (or
          SLINK2) on the command line and hit Enter.



                          2.4  SMAILFIX: Simplex Mail Fixer                          2.4  SMAILFIX: Simplex Mail Fixer


          Occasionally, systems crash and lock up.  That is almost a rule
          in the world of computing.  Unfortunately, these crashes and
          lock-ups have a nasty habit of occurring at the worst possible
          moment, and in the case of Simplex, the worst possible moment is
          when the message base is being manipulated!  Since the message
          base files are so intertwined, any corruption to any of the files
          could be quite disasterous.

          Hence the raison d'etre of SMAILFIX.  Should your message base
          appear to have become corrupted, SMAILFIX gives you a chance to
          attempt to restore/rebuild some of the message files so that you
          can recover as much of the message base as possible.  OS/2 users
          should ensure that no utilities are able to manipulate the
          message files while SMAILFIX is running, and both DOS and OS/2
          users should ensure that their systems do not shut down or reboot
          before SMAILFIX is finished.

          To run SMAILFIX, just type it's name on the command line and hit
          Enter.  Notice that you should be in your Simplex root directory
          when you do this.  SMAILFIX will prompt you if you are sure that
          you want to run it.  Answer Y and it will begin attempting to
          recover your message base.  Once it is finished it will inform
          you if you need to run SLINK and/or SPACK on the message base.

          An option for SMAILFIX is the -DATE (or /DATE) option.  This
          makes SMAILFIX delete any messages which have a date beyond
          today's date.

          This chapter describes the special network mail utilities
          provided with Simplex.  SMAIL is used in importing and exporting
          Netmail and echomail, while SMP is used to packetize the
          resultant exported and forwarded messages.

          Netmail is exported from the message base in standard FSC-0001
          message format.  Incoming Netmail may be either in standard
          FSC-0001 packed message packets or in archived format.  Outgoing
          Net mail is prepared in standard FSC-0001 packed message packets
          and then archived by SMP.

          SMAIL.EXE (or SMAIL2.EXE for OS/2) is a Netmail importation and
          exportation utility.  SMAIL is used to export Netmail and
          Echomail to other systems after mail has been entered, a
          situation which can be determined by Simplex's exit errorlevel.
          Incoming Net and echomail can be imported into the Simplex
          message base when your front-end mailer detects incoming mail

                  -c###   clean out signatures over ### days old

          SMAIL uses the unarchiver command lines specified in SCONFIG if
          you specify the -ua flag.  It also uses the packet path from
          SCONFIG as the destination directory for the contents of the
          archived mail.

          SMAIL handles Echomail signatures, which are files containing
          data from messages which have passed through the system.  These
          are kept in order to stop duplicate messages from being passed
          along.  These signatures are kept in the Simplex directory in
          files called SMAILxxx.SIG where where xxx is the Julian date of
          the year when the signature file is created.  These files can be
          maintained by using the SMAIL -c command.  This deletes signature
          files older then the specified number of days.  A reasonable
          period to keep signatures is between 3 and 10 days.  Too short a
          period might allow duplicates to slip through, and too long a
          period will slow the system down excessively while loading the
          files.  The best time in your setting will be best left to
          experimentation!

          The -RE flag reads in the signature files and generates an
          echomail traffic report for each area contained in the AREAS.BBS
          file.

          Echomail is exported generally as DIRECT (Crash) by SMAIL.  Since
          most other mail processors normally toss it out as ROUTED, SMAIL
          allows you to select the -R flag if this is your preferred
          methodology.

          Since DOS has problems with large quantities of files in a
          directory on FAT drives, systems that handle lots of mail can use
          SMAIL to limit the actual number of files in a directory by using
          the -# option.  This option will not allow *.MSG files to exceed
          the number following the # (i.e. -#250 limits the MSG files to
          250).  If mail still remains to be tossed because SMAIL reached
          this limit, it creates a file in the Simplex directory called
          SMAIL.LIM.  Your batch file can always check for the existence of
          this file and loop back to catch the rest of the mail when SMP
          completes packing.  Here is an example:

                  :unpack
                  del smail.lim
                  smail -ua -it -#250
                  smp -p
                  if exist smail.lim goto unpack


          SMAIL, by default, converts any messages addressed to "Sysop"
          over to messages addressed to the sysop's name as specified in
          SCONFIG.  This behavior might be considered annoying by some

          command line.

          Here are some sample parts of a Netmail compatible system's batch
          file which illustrate using SMAIL for exporting entered mail:

                  :runbbs
                  simplex -b%d -x
                  if errorlevel 6 goto runbbs
                  if errorlevel 5 goto echomatrix
                  if errorlevel 4 goto echo
                  if errorlevel 3 goto matrix
                  goto runbbs

                  :echomatrix
                  smail -nx -ex
                  smp -p
                  goto end

                  :echo
                  smail -ex
                  smp -p
                  goto end

                  :matrix
                  smail -nx
                  smp -p
                  goto end

                  :end

          Here is a sample of a front-end mailer's batch file,
          demonstrating the use of SMAIL for importing and forwarding
          incoming mail.

                  :runmailer
                  mailer
                  if errorlevel 2 goto runmailer
                  if errorlevel 1 goto import
                  goto end

                  :import
                  smail -ua -it
                  smp -p
                  goto runmailer

                  :end

          The -ES flag enables echomail security.  This ensures that
          echomail for each area is only imported from nodes listed for
          that echo in the AREAS.BBS file.

          The -K flag activates SMAIL to keep the SEEN-BY and PATH
          information that is contained in echomail messages as ^A kludge.
          SMAIL's default is to discard this information when importing
          messages since it tends to generate sizable messge bodies.  When
          diagnosing network problems (such as duplicate messages), it
          might be helpful to switch on this option.  Once kludge is kept,
          anyone with Sysop privilege in an echo area can use the <K>
          option while reading messages to see the resulting extra
          information.

          The AREAS.BBS file must be created by the Sysop using a plain
          text editor.  It is used by SMAIL to export and import echomail
          and it is organized as follows:

                  <msgarea number> <echo-areaname> <destination addresses>

          The <msgarea number> is the Simplex message area number as
          defined in SCONFIG.  The <echo-areaname> is the official echo
          "tag" for that echo.  The destination addresses are the addresses
          which your BBS "feeds".

          The special area "number" P is reserved for "pass through"
          echomail areas, that is areas which are not on your BBS but which
          you might be passing on to other BBSes.

          Comment lines in this file begin with a semicolon (;).

          In order to support external mail handling by other packages
          (e.g. Areafix), there is the ability to specify a "toss"
          directory.  This is done in a comment line (to avoid confusing
          older packages), and it is formatted as:

                  ; T <"name"> <destination path>

          The quotes are essential for names with embedded spaces (e.g.
          "John Doe") but not for single word names (e.g. Autoecho).

          C_ECHO, for example, is imported to area 10, and is forwarded to
          the other addresses listed.  On the other hand, AMIGA is not
          imported, but just forwarded to the listed nodes.  Note the full
          use of zone notation.  If you omit the zone and net they will
          default to the same as your zone and net number as configured in
          SCONFIG (e.g. 10 C_ECHO 401 403 404 1000 is the same as above
          since my address is 1:151/402).  Messages to areafix or to
          autoecho are tossed into the g:\bbs\areafix directory as MSG
          files.

          **Urgent**  In AREAS.BBS, the FIRST line must contain a comment
          or anything other than an echo area list.  This is for
          compatibility with older systems.

          SMP (or SMP2 for OS/2) is a Net compatible mail
          router/packer/archiver.  It uses the archiver command lines
          configured in SCONFIG.  Essentially SMP reads the messages in the
          matrix directory, and based on the rules in the SMP.CTL file (see
          above), packs the messages in packets and optionally archives
          them to their ultimate destinations.

          SMP will delete truncated (i.e. 0-length) files in the outbound
          directories before it begins packing.  Notice that it will not

          Prior to version 1.04 Simplex, it was somewhat similar to oMMM's
          CTL file, but after 1.04's release, the verbs changed radically
          to bring them in line with the new policy underlying Net mail as
          implemented in Simplex.

          Routing verbs allow mail to be converted between states (Held <->
          Routed <-> Direct), moved out and into of the reach of mailers
          (Left <-> Send), and  archived (Arc, Zip, Zoo, Lzh, Arj) to
          specific nodes.  Here is a listing of the various verbs:

            HOLDTO <destination> <sources...>
                      This causes all held mail bound to sources to be held
                      for destination.  e.g. HOLDTO 151/402 151/400 151/401
                      151/402.  This holds all held mail for 151/400, 401
                      and 402 for 151/402.

            HOSTHOLD <destinations...>
                      This causes all held mail bound to destinations to be
                      held for network host (node 0 of one's net).  e.g.
                      HOSTHOLD 151/ALL 120/ALL will cause all held mail for
                      nets 151 and 120 to be held for 151/0 (from 151/401).

            ROUTETO <destination> <sources...>
                      This causes all routed mail bound to sources to get
                      routed to destination.  e.g. ROUTETO 151/402 151/ALL
                      120/ALL will route all routed mail for nets 151 and
                      120 to 151/402.

            HOSTROUTE <destinations...>
                      This causes all routed mail bound to destinations to
                      get routed to network host (node 0 of one's net).
