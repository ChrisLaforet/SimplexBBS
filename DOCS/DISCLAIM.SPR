Simplex is copyright (c) 1989-92, Chris Laforet Software and/or ChristopherLaforet.  This copyright is waived for the distribution of the executablefiles for Simplex.  This means that you are free to distribute the Simplexexecutables as you wish as long as they are contained in the original form inwhich you received them.

Simplex executables as released by Chris Laforet Software are absolutely freeof charge to individuals and corporations.  Sale of any of these executablesis in violation of this agreement and is subject to court action.  The onlyexception to this is shareware and freeware software distribution houses areallowed to charge for distribution materials (e.g. diskettes).  Even though itis free for use, if you want to send a contribution to Chris Laforet Software,be assured that it will be cheerfully accepted!

The source code for Simplex is available for purchase from Chris LaforetSoftware.  When you purchase this code, you are granted an exclusive licenseto modify it for your own use.  The executables that you produce must never bedistributed in place of the original executables as compiled and distributedfrom Chris Laforet Software unless you arrange a royalty system with ChrisLaforet Software.  During the course of your modifications, should you developa feature which you believe should be a part of the distributed Simplexexecutables, you may submit the code to Chris Laforet Software for review andfor possible incorporation into Simplex, as long as such incorporation doesnot place Chris Laforet Software and/or Christopher Laforet under any monetaryobligations.  Your submitted code must include a cover letter indicating thatyou are freely granting permission to Chris Laforet Software for theincorporation of your code into Simplex.

Should you wish to purchase Simplex for use as a platform foranother product, or wish to convert Simplex to another language(French, Japanese, Swahili) or to another operating system (AtariST, VAX, AX-400), and wish to market the resultant product,contact Chris Laforet Software and a royalty agreement can bedeveloped.  Royalties generally range somewhere between 10% and15% of the sales price of the product, but each case is differentand merits discussion.

There are no warranties of any kind, explicit or implied, on theSimplex software.  Simplex's executables are provided on an "ASIS" basis.  What this means is that if you decide to use Simplex,it is at your own risk.  In plain English, this means that if youuse Simplex and your machine blows up, the developers anddistributors of Simplex are not responsible in any fashion.  Ifyou use Simplex and it loses all of the files on your disk, onceagain the developers and distributors of Simplex are not to beheld accountable.  While these scenarios are rather extreme innature, they serve to indicate that Chris Laforet Software and/orChristopher Laforet does not warrant, guarantee, or make anyother representations regarding the use, or results of use, ofSimplex or its documentation in terms of accuracy, reliability,correctness, currentness, or otherwise.  

Simplex has been developed and tested on a 386-20 and 386-25running OS/2 1.xx and 2.xx.  Two copies of Simplex using USRobotics Courier HST/v32bis 14.4 Kbaud Dual-Standard baud modemshave run simultaneously 24 hours/day on these setups.
