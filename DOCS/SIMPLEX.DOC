          distributors of Simplex are not responsible in any fashion.  If
          you use Simplex and it loses all of the files on your disk, once
          again the developers and distributors of Simplex are not to be
          held accountable.  While these scenarios are rather extreme in

          Simplex has been developed and tested on a 386-20 and 386-25
          running OS/2 1.xx and 2.xx.  Two copies of Simplex using US
          Robotics Courier HST/v32bis 14.4 Kbaud Dual-Standard baud modems
          have run simultaneously 24 hours/day on these setups.

          _________________________________________________________________




          Simplex is a package created for the running of a Bulletin Board
          System (BBS).  The development of Simplex arose out of Chris'
          personal gripes insofar as his inability to either fix bugs or
          add features to other BBS packages.  From the outset, Simplex was
          designed to be an easy-to-use BBS system, with C source code
          available (at a reasonable price!) to anyone who might be
          interested.  On the other hand, Simplex's executables are meant
          to be distributed as public-domain material.  There are many good
          BBSes out there, ones which have cost their SYSOPs (System
          Operators) lots of money to purchase the necessary hardware.
          There is no reason on earth why they also have to ante up lots of
          money for their BBS software.

          Simplex is somewhat based on the user interface of QuickBBS.  It
          is said that imitation is the sincerest form of praise, and it is
          in praise of QuickBBS' logical user interface (like P for Pause!)
          that Simplex emulates certain of its characteristics.

          Simplex is currently available for DOS or OS/2.  Simplex is going
          to be produced in a multiuser version for OS/2 2.0 sometime in
          the future.  There are no plans to make the DOS version
          multiuser.  There has been some murmuring of porting Simplex to
          UNIX, but this is not being done by Chris Laforet Software.

          Simplex problems may be addressed to me (Chris Laforet) at any of
          the addresses listed above.  Additional support is available
          through the SIMPLEX echo which is carried on some Fidonet or
          Worldnet boards.

          I do NOT provide voice support for Simplex unless you have
          purchased Simplex's source code.  Business concerns who are
          interested in using Simplex as part of a project may also contact
          me via telephone.  Since Simplex is free to users, it is not fair
          for you to also expect real-time voice support for it.  If you
          encounter a major bug in Simplex, and contact me by mail or E-
          mail, I might request a phone number from you so that I could
          contact you voice to discuss it in greater depth.

          _________________________________________________________________




          DOS users of Simplex will require a FOSSIL driver such as Ray
          Gwinn's excellent X00 package.  FOSSILs are available on most
          BBSes and services.  A FOSSIL driver is a special program which
          provides an interface to communications ports.  OS/2 users do not
          have to use a fossil since OS/2 already supports communications
          ports with interrupt-driven drivers.

          Please take careful note:  Simplex users must have a modem which          Please take careful note:
          is capable of CTS-RTS handshaking (many 2400 baud modems control
          this with &R1).  Also, Simplex requires that DTR controls the
          on-line state of the modem (most 2400 baud modems control this
          with &D2) and CD (carrier detect) must correctly follow the
          remote's carrier (controlled with &C1 om many 2400 baud modems).
          Without these criteria being met, Simplex probably will not work
          on your system.

          DOS users of Simplex must set up to have a sufficient number of
          file handles available for Simplex to run.  This is done by
          editing/creating a file called CONFIG.SYS which is found in the
          root directory of the boot drive (A: or C:) and ensuring that
          there is an entry that sets files greater than or equal to 30.
          If it is there, but less than 30, change it to 30.  If it is not
          there, add a line that says:

                  files=30

          and then save your changes.  The machine must then be rebooted to
          install the changes.  OS/2 users of Simplex do not have to do
          anything special to raise their file handles.

          OS/2 users might want to play with their timeslice statement in
          their CONFIG.SYS to achieve a smoother flow of the BBS.  On the
          386-20 and 386-25 at Chris Laforet Software, a timeslice of 32,96
          appears to achieve acceptable results.   The priority statement
          should be set to dynamic and the maxwait should be 1 or 2.  The
          memman statement should include swap and move, especially if your
          system suffers from "RAM cram".  If you are planning to run your
          machine as a dedicated BBS, then autofail should be set to yes so
          that your system will handle fatal system errors and not hang
          waiting for keyboard input.  Here is a sample from the OS/2
          CONFIG.SYS that runs the Programmer's Oases BBSes:

                  memman=swap,protect (OS/2 2.0 only)

          This works well for the both the OS/2 1.3 and the OS/2 2.0 setup.

          Simplex will answer the phone by itself as long as your modem
          returns string results (like Hayes).  In SCONFIG you can
          configure your modem's strings for Simplex to monitor.  If you
          are running a FidoNet or other network node, then you will
          probably have a front-end mailer answer the phone for you.  See
          below for more details of using a mailer.

          If you are running Simplex as a simple host program, you might
          want to use the ringback feature.  This feature permits you to
          use your voice line for your host and not have to worry too much
          about your modem answering the phone and surprising one of your
          friends!  How this works is that a person wishing to call your
          host rings the number and allows it to ring less than 4 times.
          This will then arm the answer feature.  They can then call back
          in less than 40 to 50 seconds and the modem will answer them.
          After they hang up, the system will be back in an unarmed state.

          _________________________________________________________________




          Net mail has been implemented in Simplex 1.04 with a number of
          underlying presumptions.  The first and foremost of these is that
          all users should have access to Net mail.  The second of these is
          that file attaching should be controllable by the Sysop and
          access to this feature should be granted exclusively by him/her.
          The third of these is that when Echomail discussions get off-
          topic, they should be taken to netmail.

          The first presumption is demonstrated when a user without mail
          credit decides to enter a Net message.  They are permitted to
          send the message, but can only choose to send it as Routed mail
          or as Held mail.  If the user has sufficient credit, they can
          send it as Direct mail or either of the previous two types.

          Simplex looks at mail as a three-layered system.  These three
          layers are as follows (compared with oMMM's mail extensions):

                    Direct Mail                   oMMM's CM
                    Routed Mail                   oMMM's Normal
                    Held Mail                     oMMM's Held

          Direct mail is mail that is intended to be sent DIRECTLY from
          your node to the destination (whether this is indeed how it is
          sent depends upon the Sysop!).  Routed mail is that which is
          supposed to follow a routing path through the network.  Held mail
          is that which is supposed to be held for pickup by another node
          which polls yours at specific intervals.

          Notice that the three-layered system is all theoretical.  For
          example, none of my nodes sends Netmail bound for international
          locations directly to them, regardless of if the message was
          specified as being Direct.  It is much cheaper to send direct
          mail to the specified Zone gates and let them be routed from
          there.  On the other hand, if someone enters a message to a local
          node and specifies that it is to be Held, it is transformed to
          Direct mail and sent immediately (since the node is local, it
          doesn't cost anything, right?).

          The way that you implement the three-layered system is controlled
          by your use of SMP (or SMP/2) to handles your specific routing
          needs.  SMP's routing verbs are discussed later on in this file.

          The second presumption in Simplex is that the option to Netmail
          file-attaching is under control of the Sysop.  How this control
          is exerted is by means of a flag in the user's record.  The Sysop
          must be careful with who is granted the privilege of file-
          attaching since a hacker can easily file-attach critical files
          (like userlist.bbs?) to themselves at another node if they have
          any idea how your system is laid out!!  Please notice that the
          local file-attaching feature works differently.  Only files from
          a specific sysop-specified directory can be attached to another
          user on the same system.

          The third presumption in Simplex is that Echomail discussions
          should go over to Netmail when they start drifting off-topic.
          This is implemented by a special option that appears while
          reading Echomail messages which permits users to reply directly
          to the message using Netmail.  Notice that the user can only

          If you want to use Simplex as a Net node, you will need to use
          some sort of a front-end mailer software such as BinkleyTerm or
          FrontDoor.  This software is needed in order to handle mail
          transactions between your node and other Net nodes.  Whatever
          mailer you use must comply with oMMM message bundle formatting
          (unless you choose to write a message handling interface between
          your mailer and Simplex).

          Simplex needs a special directory which it uses as an interface
          to the front-end mailer.  Traditionally, this directory has been
          named the MATRIX directory.  This directory is used during the
          exportation/forwarding of messages from Simplex to other nodes.
          The format of these messages is the standard FidoNet message
          format as outlined in their FSC-0001 standard (1.MSG, 2.MSG,
          etc.).  These messages are then taken by mail bundlers such as
          oMMM or SMP and bundled for the front-end mailer.  It is
          essential that this directory not be used for anything else.

          Simplex also needs a special directory where inbound bundles and
          message packets are placed.  Traditionally, this directory has
          been called INBOUND.  The front-end mailer will place the inbound
          bundles in message packets here once they have been successfully
          received.  Simplex's mail utilities will scan this directory for
          any unpacked bundles or packets which it would proceed to unpack.
          It is not essential that this area be used exclusively for
          inbound mail since Simplex searches for bundles and packets based
          on their file extensions.

          Simplex requires a special directory which can be used as a
          "scratch" area.  This directory is essential and must be used
          exclusively by Simplex.  It is suggested that you call this
          directory PACKET since it is used to hold unarchived inbound mail
          bundles.  This directory is essential because once the mail is
          unarchived, the archives are deleted.  If the packets are not
          unpacked for any reason, they will remain intact until Simplex's
          mail utilities are run once again.  This directory along with the
          inbound directory is searched for message packets every time
          Simplex's mail utilities are run.

          All members of a FidoNet compatible network are listed in a file
          called a nodelist.  In order to be able to communicate with other
          nodes, BBS and mailer software must have access to this nodelist.
          Simplex is no exception to this rule.  It requires that the
          nodelist be compiled using any Version 6 nodelist compiler
          (Version 6 nodelists are used by BinkleyTerm, Opus, and many
          other FidoNet utilities) such as ParseList.  Simplex must know
          exactly where to find the compiled nodelist.

          Simplex requires a Net node's address.  This address uniquely
          identifies the node during communications with other Net nodes.
          A FidoNet-compatible address consists of a Zone (read continent
          or network), a Net, and a Node number such as 1:3644/1 which
          identifies Simplex's "home" node as being in Zone 1 (Fidonet,
          North America), Net 3644 (Burlington-Graham, NC), and Node 1 in
          that net.  While use of the Zone number is not absolutely
          essential at this time and it is perfectly acceptable to list
          your Zone number as 0, such use should be frowned upon in a
          network which is worldwide in nature!  Hence Simplex does
          somewhat attempt to enforce the use of the Zone number.

          Finally, Simplex needs a nodelist.  The nodelist must be compiled
          with any nodelist compiler that produces a "Version 6" nodelist.
          This is the same type of nodelist used by Opus<Tm> and
          BinkleyTerm.  Nodelist compilers such as Parselst produce the
          correct formatted nodelist files.

          In order to run Simplex without Net support, a Sysop needs to
          make sure that none of the following conditions are true:

               1.  There is no path set pointing to the nodelist in section
                   4 of SCONFIG.
               2.  There is no node address in section 1 of SCONFIG.
               3.  There are no message areas marked as being Netmail.

          Once these conditions are checked, Simplex will not attempt to
          start up with a nodelist.

          _________________________________________________________________




          Simplex may be started by merely typing Simplex on the command
          line (OS/2 users use Simplex2) and pressing Enter in the assigned
          Simplex directory.   However, it is doubtful that such simple use
          would suffice for most applications of Simplex!  Hence Simplex
          accepts a series of command line arguments that permit you to
          call it under specified conditions, and it returns with specific
          errorlevels to indicate that certain events have occurred.

          The Simplex command line may include any of the following
          options.  A list of these options might be obtained by typing
          Simplex -? on the command line.  Most of these options are meant
          to be used when spawning Simplex from a front-end Net mailer, but
          some are even handy for use in simple host applications:

             -Bxxxx Startup at the specified baud (User is online)
             -D     Drop in to Simplex with user's info in simplex.usr
             -H     Do not hangup before exiting
             -L     Startup in local mode (same as -B0)
             -Mxxxx Locked baud rate. Set port to baud and ignore connect
                    strings
             -O     DOS: Swap out to EMS or Disk when spawning external
                    processes
             -OD    DOS: Swap out to Disk when spawning external processes
             -OE    DOS: Swap out to EMS when spawning external processes
             -Pxxx  DOS: Use the specified comm port *or*
             -Pxxx  OS/2: Use the specified comm handle
             -R     Do ringback model of call answering
             -S     DOS: Do not close stdout and reopen it to NUL
             -Txxx  Set maximum time user is allowed on system
             -X     Exit after carrier is lost or after logoff

          The DOS version has the -S option because of the propensity of
          some fossil drivers to "sign-on" with a message each time they
          are initialized by Simplex (e.g. Ray Gwinn's x00.sys).  This
          behavior has the tendency to kill Simplex's screen formatting
          which is undesirable.  So, by default, Simplex closes the
          standard output file handle (handle 1) and reopens it pointing to
          NUL.  This is the equivalent of typing "simplex > nul" at the
          command line!  If your fossil does not do this, or it causes
          problems on your system, you may specify the -S flag to stop
          Simplex from closing the handle.

          The -M option enables a mailer program to actually pass a locked
          baud rate as a separate entity from the actual baud rate.
          Passing the correct connect baud is important for correctly
          calculating transfer times for downloads.  Simplex NEVER sets the
          baud rate when it is passed an open port with -P and -B.  Passing
          the locked rate at this time doesn't achieve any real purpose if
          there is a -X, but this might change in the future.

          The -D option permits Simplex to be called as a door to another
          program.  The other program must somehow create the login file
          "simplex.usr" according to the following byte-packed C structure.
          All strings are terminated with nul characters (0).

          struct uf
            {
            char uf_name[41];  /* nul-terminated user name, first last */
            char uf_password[16];   /* nul-terminated password */
            char uf_city[31];  /* nul-terminated city, state */
            char uf_home[15];  /* nul-terminated user's home number */
            char uf_data[15];  /* nul-terminated user's data number */
            char uf_screenlen;  /* length of users screen in lines */
            int uf_flags;  /* bitmapped option flags, see URGENT.DOC */
            };

          The user is logged in and if they have never entered Simplex
          before, their user record is created automatically.  The -D
          option automatically sets the -X flag so that Simplex will exit
          if the user drops carrier or logs off.

          The -O option is for DOS users who run external programs.  The
          Simplex program has been dynamically overlay linked, which will
          allow it to fit into a smaller chunk of memory than a straight
          linked version would.  The -O flag will swap as much of Simplex
          to EMS or to disk as possible before spawning an external program
          so that the external program will get a larger memory block.  The
          -O will look first for EMS and swap to it if there is enough,
          otherwise it will swap to disk.  If you have EMS and wish to
          reserve it for an external program, use the -OD flag which will
          force it to use the disk even if there is enough EMS.  The -OE
          will force it to use EMS first (same as the -O flag).  Swapping
          to disk will look for an environment variable TEMP.  If it is not
          found, it will look for an environment variable TMP.  If this is
          not found, it uses the current directory.  The TEMP/TMP variable
          can contain one or a series of paths that are acceptable swapping
          locations like this:

                  set TEMP=h:\;g:\temp
                  set TMP=d:\temp

          It is wise to use your fastest drive (e.g. RAM drive) for
          swapping, but you will need at least 600K free for swapping to be
          successful.

          A front-end mailer program might spawn Simplex with the following
          command line in a batch file:

                  simplex2 -B%1 -P%2 -X

          or for a local session, it might use the following:

                  simplex2 -L -X

          In order to let batch files know what is causing Simplex to exit,
          it returns different errorlevels.  The following errorlevels are
          currently supported in Simplex.

               0    Normal Simplex exit prompted by Alt-X keystroke.
               1    Simplex had an internal error.
               2    Normal Simplex exit after user was on and -X or (-D)
                    was on command line.
               3    Netmail was entered and Alt-X pressed or -X (-D) was on
                    command line.
               4    Echomail was entered and Alt-X pressed or -X (-D) was
                    on command line.
               5    Netmail and Echomail were entered and Alt-X pressed or
                    -X (-D) was on command line.
               6+   Errorlevel generated by an event exit.

          Errorlevel 2 is especially created for simple Simplex host
          applications which need to know if to run external utilities such
          as SRECENT or SUSAGE (see below).  Obviously, if you have exited
          from a waiting-state with Alt-X, there is no need to check to see
          if the last user has been added to the database.  Hence you could
          have a batch file similar to this:

                  set simplex=d:\host
                  :runhost
                  d:
                  cd \host
                  simplex2 -x
                  if errorlevel 3 goto runhost
                  if errorlevel 1 goto recent
                  if errorlevel 0 goto end

                  :recent
                  srecent 20
                  susage -G -I
                  goto runhost

          A Network compatible BBS might have something like:

                  :runbbs
                  simplex -b%1 -x
                  if errorlevel 6 goto recent

          _________________________________________________________________




          As of version 1.06.00, Simplex changed its methods of handling
          file areas.  Instead of continuing with the time honored
          FILES.BBS format, Simplex branched into its own binary format.
          The new file format is as follows:

          struct fe       /* 384-byte file entry structure */
            {
            char fe_name[16];
            int fe_location;      /* area number this file is located in */
            char fe_descrip[257];
            char fe_group[41];    /* grouping for this item */
            char fe_uploader[41];
            unsigned int fe_uldate;
            unsigned int fe_dldate;       /* last date downloaded */
            unsigned int fe_dl;           /* number of downloads */
            unsigned int fe_priv;         /* min priv level to see/dl this
          file */
            int fe_flags;                 /* flags to see/dl this file */
            char fe_reserved[17];
            };

          This format is encountered in files called FILELIST.BBS which is
          located in each file area's directory.  This new format leads to
          three major problems which can be easily resolved as follows:

               First is that it is no longer easily edited using a text
               editor (since it is binary, not text).  The solution to this
               problem is in SCONFIG in the form of an editor for file
               areas.

               Second is that one cannot personalize file areas by putting
               header information at the top of FILES.BBS.  This problem is
               solved by Simplex showing a text file called FILEHEAD.BBS in
               each file area (if it exists) which can contain any
               information that the Sysop wants to include.

               Third is that specialized file-tossing programs for SDS-like
               echos (such as TIC and FLEA) toss files into areas and
               create entries in a FILES.BBS in those areas.  The solution
               to this problem lies in a program called SFAC which compiles
               the resultant FILES.BBS and adds its contents to
               FILELIST.BBS.

          The new format introduces many handy features that are worth the
          extra effort.  Here is a list of some of these features:

               a.  Files can be listed in areas and the file entries can
                   point at the actual areas where they are located (other
                   than the current area).  This introduces the concept of
                   file aliasing.
               b.  Files have a privilege level and flags attached to them.
                   This strictly enforces visibility and downloadability of
                   files.
               c.  Files that are not contained in FILELIST.BBS cannot be
                   downloaded by anyone.  There is no fear of someone
                   accidentally finding a backdoor to download a crucial
                   file.
               d.  File information can be searched easily which enables
                   cross-area downloading.  Cross-area searching should be
                   quicker too since Simplex doesn't have to waste time
                   parsing text files.
               e.  The upload date is kept.  Thus, protocols which provide
                   the timestamp of files being uploaded can set the
                   timestamp of the file correctly once receieved.  When a
                   person asks to see new files since a specific date,
                   files that have a timestamp or an upload date later than
                   said date are shown as new.
               f.  The name of the uploader is kept.  One can judge the
                   reliability of a file once the source is known.
               g.  A download tally is kept on each file.  It is possible
                   to see which files are popular and which ones are not.
               h.  The date of the last download is kept on each file.
                   This permits programs to be developed that kill off
                   useless files and free valuable disk space.

          _________________________________________________________________




          Version 1.05.02 of Simplex was the first version to support virus
          checking after uploads.  SCONFIG allows you to specify a virus
          checking program to be called after uploads.  The program is
          called after the upload but before the user is asked for
          descriptions.  NOTICE that regardless of the program information,
          Simplex will add on two other arguments.  These are (a) the full
          pathname to the upload list (UPLOAD#?.BBS where ? is the node
          number) and (b) the node number which will be used for the
          (DORINFO?.DEF).  If there is the name of a program in SCONFIG,
          then when the program gets called, it will have 2 arguments.

          The virus checker is expected to open the upload list file, read
          it and then check all files listed as OK.  If it finds a virus
          file, it must replace the OK with BAD and delete the file.  When
          Simplex regains control, it will get descriptions for the files
          marked OK and will attempt to delete the ones marked BAD.

          Each line in the upload list file is organized as follows:

                  OK  filename filesize
                  BAD filename 0

          Notice that "OK " is replaced by "BAD" if an uploaded file is
          bad, and no description is needed.

          Notice that the virus checking interface program can call any
          virus scanner and is responsible for determining the archive
          type.  Notice that duplicate files are renamed to filename.###
          where ### is a three digit number.  Hence, the archive type must
          be determined from looking for signatures in the file.

          There are a number of features in Simplex that cater exclusively
          to the sysop or the user running in local mode.  These are
          evaluated in the following sections.



          8.1-The Sysop's Keyboard          8.1-The Sysop's Keyboard
          _________________________________________________________________




          While a user is online, the Sysop has a number of keys at his
          disposal.  These can be used to raise or lower the user's time,
          drop into chat mode, or terminate a user.

          The following keys are active on the Sysop's keyboard when a user
          is online:

               Alt-A      Abort upload or download.  This key combination
                          is the only one active during uploads and
                          downloads and has no meaning otherwise.
               Alt-C      Initiate chat mode.  Once in chat mode, ESC exits
                          and returns the user to the BBS.  Ctrl-G sends a
                          beep to the other terminal and Ctrl-L toggles the
                          Sysop's chat log on and off.  Ctrl-F toggles in
                          an 8th bit filter which is handy when you
                          encounter a user who is online with 7-E-1 instead
                          of 8-N-1 and you wish to chat with them and tell
                          them of their mistake!
               Alt-F      Edit a user's flags.  In this mode, merely press
                          the letter corresponding to the flag you wish to
                          toggle and press Enter to finish.
               Alt-H      Help!  Toggle showing of sysop keys on status
                          line.
               Alt-J      Jump to DOS (or OS/2) shell.  This suspends the
                          BBS and allows you to work at the DOS prompt.
                          When you are finished, type "exit" at the prompt
                          and the BBS will regain control.
               Alt-K      Switch keyboard on or off.  This is handy if
                          there is any danger of keys being pressed
                          accidentally by little fingers.

               Alt-L      Logoff Notification.  This option will play a
                          tune when a user logs off to inform the Sysop
                          that the system is available.  This is a toggle
                          option.  When active, the user's time left in the
                          status line will indicate an asterisk (*) next to
                          it.
               Alt-P      Edit a user's privilege level.  Once in this
                          mode, type in the new user's privilege level
                          (between 1 and 255) and hit Enter to change it.
                          To cancel changes, just press Enter on an empty
                          field.
               Alt-T      Terminate a user's session.  Hangs up the modem
                          immediately.
               Alt-X      Exit Simplex while it is waiting for a call.

               Ctrl-PgUp  Increase a user's time by one minute.
               Ctrl-PgDn  Decrease a user's time by one minute.

          While in local mode, the upload and download options would seem
          superfluous.  However, Simplex uses them as specialized copy
          commands.

          A local download will ask for a destination directory and then a
          list of filenames.  It would then copy the files to that
          directory.

          A local upload will ask for a source directory and then a list of
          filenames.  It would then copy the files in to the current file
          area and then prompt for file descriptions for each file.

          In local mode, a privileged user (user with Sysop level in that
          message area) will have an <E>xport option on his/her message
          menu.  This permits the user to send a copy of the message to any
          file or device.  To send the message to the printer on lpt1:,
          just enter the name LPT1 as the export filename and press Enter.

          _________________________________________________________________




          The Sysop can set the hours that yelling for a chat is permitted.
          By default, the hours are set from 00:00 to 23:59.  The hours can
          wrap around midnight if that is desired (e.g. start at 23:00 and
          end at 04:00).

          In addition to setting the hours for yelling, the Sysop can set
          the duration of the yell tone.

          There is a special option in Simplex which allows the Sysop to
          set up a special "timeless" yell.  This can be protected by
          privilege level and flags to only permit close friends or clients
          to access it!

          Simplex, as of v 1.04.02, enforces downloading hours as set up in
          SCONFIG.  By default, these hours extend from 00:00 to 23:59 (all
          day), but they can be set to reflect any downloading time zone
          that you care to enforce.  The start time does not HAVE to be
          earlier than the stop time (e.g. from 17:00 to 08:00) since it
          will wrap around the midnight hour.

          Sysops can still download outside of these hours.  In order to
          implement this feature in v 1.04.02, everyone with a priv level
          of 250->255 is considered "Sysop" level.  This will disappear in
          a future version of Simplex wherein you can set the level to what
          you prefer it to be.

          There is an option in Simplex which permits a user (preferably
          set for the Sysop only!) to move files from one area to another.
          The Sysop can then create a list of files to move from one area

          flags for each moved file to match those of the destination area.

          _________________________________________________________________




          Simplex is distributed with a few basic utilities.  Here is how
          these utilities work.



          9.1-SFAC: Simplex File Area Compiler          9.1-SFAC: Simplex File Area Compiler
          _________________________________________________________________




          Version 1.06 of Simplex was the first version to break with the
          time-honored FILES.BBS method of handling file areas.
          Essentially, FILES.BBS was a text file which contained lines of
          text which were formatted as <FILENAME> <DESCRIPTION>.  In order
          to implement a secure and fast file handling system, Simplex had
          to move over to using binary files containing information about
          each file.

          In order to gain the extra power promised by the newer database
          format, it appeared that Sysops would lose the convenience of
          Network SDS file utilities such as TIC and FLEA, which output
          their information into FILES.BBS format!

          SFAC (SFAC2 in OS/2) overcomes this apparent dilemma by taking
          FILES.BBS and compiling into the format needed in the new binary
          FILELIST.BBS and appending the results to the end of
          FILELIST.BBS.  SFAC can be told to set the upload date to today's
          date, to set the uploader name to some string, and to delete
          FILES.BBS if conversion is successful.

          SFAC's command line is:

                  sfac [-options] Filearea

          SFAC's options are as follows:

               -d               use current date as upload date.
               -k               kill "files.bbs" after transferring data.
               -uuploader_name  set uploader name to "uploader name".
               -f               create a files.bbs listing from
               filelist.bbs.

                                       Page 23                                       Page 23






          If you use SFAC by itself (no options), it will look in the
          specified file area and open FILES.BBS and convert any file
          listings that have corresponding files (i.e. files are not
          missing) and add them to the end of the FILELIST.BBS.  The
          uploader's name is left blank and the upload date is set to the
          file's date.  The FILES.BBS is left intact after the operation.

          The -K option will make SFAC delete FILES.BBS after a successful
          transfer of its contents to FILELIST.BBS.

          Using the -D option will set the upload date to the current date,
          regardless of the file's date.

          The -U option allows you to set the uploader's name to a string
          (maximum length is 40 characters).  Notice that you must insert
          underscores (_) to substitute for spaces (e.g. User's_Name).

          The -F option permits you to run SFAC to generate a standard
          FILES.BBS file for some reason or another.  This is added to
          provide compatibility with other software which uses this format.

          If you run TIC to import SDS files, you can let TIC create a
          regular FILES.BBS in the target area and immediately afterwards
          run SFAC to update FILELIST.BBS with the new files.  Here is a
          sample from a batch file:

                  ticp
                  sfac2 -u"SDS file imported by TIC" -d -k 41
                  sfac2 -u"SDS file imported by TIC" -d -k 42
                  sfac2 -u"SDS file imported by TIC" -d -k 43
                  sfac2 -u"SDS file imported by TIC" -d -k 44
                  sfac2 -u"SDS file imported by TIC" -d -k 45

          This assumes that TIC tosses files into file areas 41 through 45.
          If nothing is tossed into any of the areas, SFAC will report that
          there is nothing to do and exit.

          _________________________________________________________________




          In order to assist you in preparing your ANSI and ASCII files,
          Simplex includes a compiler and a high-level language.  This
          system is called SANSI.  You can write a single "source" file
          which includes all of the information for screens which can be
          compiled into the respective .ANS and .ASC files.  The compiler
          will leave any ANSI statements out of of the .ASC files.



                  --------------------------------------------------

          The SANSI language will also access to special Simplex features
          as well as ANSI codes.  Special SANSI codes are introduced with `
          (forward single quote) in the .ANS and .ASC files (`` is
          interpreted by Simplex as being a `), however, use of the high-
          level language is strongly recommended for ease of maintenance.

          SANSI keywords are encoded in text in curly braces as in
          {sequence}.  Any number of SANSI keywords may be included in the
          curly braces separated by spaces (like {stopoff cls bell}).  To
          encode an true opening curly brace, simply type two in a row like
          this {{.  For a description of the SANSI language, see the
          respective section in SETUP.DOC.



          9.3-SMC: Simplex Menu Compiler          9.3-SMC: Simplex Menu Compiler
          _________________________________________________________________




          SMC can be used instead of SCONFIG to lay out menus.
          Essentially, SMC can decompile a standard .MNU file into an ASCII
          representation which can then be edited using a plain text
          editor.  The resulting file can then be submitted to SMC to be
          recompiled into a menu file.

          To decompile a menu, you can use SMC as follows:

                  smc /d file.mnu > file.smc

          The "> file.smc" is needed since SMC outputs its decompilation
          information to standard output (normally the screen).  Using the
          ">" allows you to send it into whatever file you wish to.  DOS
          and OS/2 gurus will also recognize the ability to concatenate a
          bunch of menus into one file using the ">>" operator!

          Running SMC by itself gives a listing of the currently supported
          menu types.  It is handy to have a printout of these, so a good
          idea might be to do:

                  smc > prn

          or whatever printer device you wish.

          To compile a menu .SMC file, you need to do:

                  smc file.smc

          and it will create menu files according to the menu directives
          contained in the source file.

          Using the SMC compiler will permit you to use the script language
          to put together a series of menus (you can have more than one
          menu in a .SMC file) and avoid the overhead of using the line-
          by-line menu editor in SCONFIG.

          _________________________________________________________________




          SUPACK.EXE (or SUPACK2.EXE for OS/2) is a utility to purge
          deleted users from the Simplex user's list.  Just run the utility
          from the command line whenever you have deleted users.  This
          utility will pack the USERLIST.BBS file, the MSGCOMB.BBS (for
          combined boards), and MSGREAD.BBS (for lastread pointers) into
          .BAK files.  If everything is successful, the .BBS files will
          then be deleted and the .BAK files will be renamed.

          If a Sysop chooses to use Simplex's advertising areas, he/she
          will eventually have to purge deleted ads out of the *.AD files.
          To do this, Simplex provides SAPACK.EXE.  Using SAPACK is a
          breeze.  Simply

                  sapack filename[.ad]

          To purge ads from a file called FOR_SALE.AD, either of the
          following command lines will work:

                  sapack for_sale.ad
                  sapack for_sale

          When finished, SAPACK will provide a small report on how many
          entries were purged.

          _________________________________________________________________




          There are two utilities which can be used by Simplex in order to
          generate special screens.  These are SUSAGE, a utility which
          generates an hourly usage chart for your system, and SRECENT, a
          utility which creates and maintains a recent callers listing.  In
          order to take advantage of these utilities, one must have the BBS
          exit after each user has logged off.  Both of these utilities
          read and utilize the USERINFO.BBS file created when a user logs
          in.

          SUSAGE must have the -G option enabled in order to generate usage
          files.  These files are placed in the screens directory and are
          appropriately named SUSAGE.ANS and SUSAGE.ASC.  These files
          normally use normal 7-bit ASCII characters to build the bar
          charts, but should you prefer to use IBM 8-bit characters, you
          can specify that with the optional -I switch.

          SRECENT must have a numeric option which specifies the number of
          last callers that you want to keep up with.  SRECENT 30 will keep
          information on 30 users and will build the screens with that
          information.  The resulting screens are placed in the screens
          directory and are called SRECENT.ANS and SRECENT.ASC.

          You may list names which you do not wish to show up on the recent
          callers list by creating a file with an editor in the Simplex
          directory called SRECENT.CFG.  This file would contain the first
          and last names of people who are exempt from SRECENT separated by
          an ENTER.  For example:

          Susan Smith
          Fred Flintstone
          John Doe
          Jane Doe

          Whenever these people log off, they will not be included in the
          recent-callers list.

          _________________________________________________________________




          You may create quote files for Simplex which are searched for
          random sayings either on login (see DAYQUOTE.CQ and DAYQUOT2.CQ
          in SETUP.DOC) or in response to a type 52 menu option.  These
          files can contain salty wisdom sayings, scripture verses,
          variations on Murphy's Law, short jokes, or whatever else you
          desire.  Simplex can "randomly" select one of these sayings on
          demand and show it to the user.

          Creating quote files is a rather simple operation.  You need to
          edit a flat-ASCII file containing one quote per line (Maximum of
          512 characters per saying) and then compile it using SQUOTE.  The
          quote file produced by SQUOTE must be placed in the screen files
          directory.  The uncompiled quote file must have a .Q extension
          (e.g. DAYQUOTE.Q) and the compiler will create a file with a .CQ
          extension (e.g. DAYQUOTE.CQ).

          Here is an example of a simple uncompiled quote file:

             The toast always falls on the carpet buttered-side down!
             A penny saved is a penny earned.

             God is love. (I John 4:16a NIV)
             For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
               life in Chris Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23 NIV)

          Notice that each line is an individual saying.  Blank lines
          between quote lines will not hurt anything so you could group
          similar sayings together and separate them with blank lines as
          above.  This might make it easier to maintain your quote files.

          Assume that the above file is called DAYQUOTE.Q, compiling it is
          achieved by doing either of the following:

                  squote dayquote
                  squote dayquote.q

          where the .Q is assumed and is optional.  The compiler will
          indicate how many lines of quotes it found and write out a
          DAYQUOTE.CQ file.

          First of all, thanks goes to God for His strength and guidance
          during the development of Simplex BBS.  Without His Spirit, this
          project would never have made it off of the ground!

          I know that it is not very often that I seem appreciative of the
          many bug reports from my beta testers, especially since bugs pop
          up at the most inconvenient times.  I know that getting a BBS up
          and running can be rough especially when you have bugs to contend
          with, and users who jump all over you when features break down!!
          Thank you guys for a job well done, and may I add, keep up the
          good work.

          The job accomplished by beta testers is so important and yet it
          is downplayed.  These are the guys who actually stand on the
          front line and get pounded by bugs and undocumented "features".
          Special thanks goes to my beta testers:

               Scott Hughes of NightHawk BBS
               Tony Till of The Starship BBS
               Dale Robertson of D & R BBS
               Robbie Foust of Stardate Multiline BBS

          Thanks goes especially for my wife, Sherry, a "computer widow"
          who spent much time listening to me pecking at the keyboard late
          into the night for the many months spent while developing
          Simplex.  She is the one who named the package and I dedicate it
          to her and to my lovely daughter Rebekah.

          Thanks to Brady Flowers of Oberon Software in Mankato, MN for
          helping me through some of OS/2's uncharted reefs!

          Thanks to those who have helped in many little ways, including
          beta testing over the past versions.  I would like to mention the
          following names in this regard:

               Kelly Hughes of Bedside Manor BBS
               Fred Niemczenia of The Warped Drive BBS
               Robbie Foust of Stardate Multiline BBS
               Craig Newlander of Chicago, Ill
               Steven Tower of Neutral Zone BBS
               Al Pollenz of Dateline 2100 BBS

          Thanks to the many people who have made excellent suggestions for
          features in Simplex over the course of time.  Thanks also to the
          many kind souls who reported bugs and who sent messages of
          encouragement.

          Thanks to those dedicated users who have taken time to write
          utilities for Simplex.  Any BBS package is improved by having a
          rich set of external programs to enhance it.  In this respect,
          Simplex's ultimate success will depend upon the utility writers.
          Sometimes, the utility authors help to improve the package by
          making suggestions for additional features to support their
          utilities.  Invariably this helps to shape Simplex into a better
          package!
