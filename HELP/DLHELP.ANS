[0;33;1m<1> Xmodem       [0;36m- This is the most common protocol and is found in most
                   communications programs.  It is not the best choice if you
                   have one of the others.
[0;33;1m<2> Xmodem-1k    [0;36m- Same thing except it sends information at 1024 bytes
                   in one block instead of 128 bytes like Xmodem.  This makes
                   it a little faster.
[0;33;1m<3> Ymodem-Bat   [0;36m- Batch Ymodem.  This protocol is similar to Xmodem-1K
                   but also sends filenames, sizes, and dates.  This means 
                   that you can send multiple files at the same time.
[0;33;1m<4> Ymodem-G     [0;36m- This is similar to Batch Ymodem except it has no error
                   correction.  Use this ONLY if your modem handles MNP error
                   correction.
[0;33;1m<5> Zmodem       [0;36m- The fastest one of all if you do not have an MNP modem.
                   It has automatic download startup, automatic resume, and
                   other features which make it a great all-round protocol.
[0;33;1m<X> Exit         [0;36m- Exits to the previous menu.
