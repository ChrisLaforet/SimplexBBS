<1> Xmodem       - This is the most common protocol and is found in most
                   communications programs.  It is not the best choice if you
                   have one of the others.
<2> Xmodem-1k    - Same thing except it sends information at 1024 bytes
                   in one block instead of 128 bytes like Xmodem.  This makes
                   it a little faster.
<3> Ymodem-Bat   - Batch Ymodem.  This protocol is similar to Xmodem-1K
                   but also sends filenames, sizes, and dates.  This means 
                   that you can send multiple files at the same time.
<4> Ymodem-G     - This is similar to Batch Ymodem except it has no error
                   correction.  Use this ONLY if your modem handles MNP error
                   correction.
<5> Zmodem       - The fastest one of all if you do not have an MNP modem.
                   It has automatic download startup, automatic resume, and
                   other features which make it a great all-round protocol.
<X> Exit         - Exits to the previous menu.
