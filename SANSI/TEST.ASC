Hello there `B`C


1> Important Bulletins
   -------------------

   a.  Notice!  This BBS will no longer be accessible during 4 to 5 am since 
       that time is Zone Mail Hour.  
   b.  Everything has been lost from this BBS due to a disk crash.  The
       tape backup was damaged also, so the Oasis is starting from scratch.
       If you have any files that you downloaded from here in their original
       form, please upload them!!  
   c.  Scott and I are working as quickly as possible to get our BBS back
       up to snuff.  Please be patient with us!
   d.  Since the user list was lost also, everyone will have to 
       start from scratch again.  Sorry about that.
