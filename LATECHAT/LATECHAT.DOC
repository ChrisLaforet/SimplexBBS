 LateChat -- A split screen chat program.  By Chris Laforet and Kelly Hughes


 Purpose:
--------------------

        This program is an alternate chat program that can be run from
        a BBS.  Unlike many other external chat programs, this one
        splits the screen and keeps the sysop's typing in the top half
        and the user's typing in the bottom.  By keeping typing
        separated, the sysop and user may type at the same time without
        confusion!

        LateChat provides automatic word-wrap, and provides keys to
        redraw screen (remotely or locally), shell to the operating
        system (locally), as well as a quick-hangup key for the sysop.


 Requirements:
--------------------

        The OS/2 version does not require anything except normal OS/2.
        Under DOS, a FOSSIL driver (e.g. Ray Gwinn's X00.SYS) is required.
        This fossil provides interrupt driven input and output and enables
        automatic watching of the carrier detect signal on the modem.
        By providing CD watching, it is not necessary to run LateChat
        from a batch file.

        Most DOS bulletin board software is written to be used with the
        fossil, and source code written for the fossil is easily ported
        to other systems for which a fossil exists.

        LateChat depends on ANSI escape sequences to control the screen,
        so it must be active for a user that is going to use it. By
        passing the ANSI status in the call from the board, you will
        automatically prevent someone from accidentally using LateChat
        with their graphics flag turned off.  LateChat will give the
        user a message if this happens.


 Summary screen:
--------------------

 If you run LateChat with no parameters, you get a screenload of
 explanation.  Here is a breakdown...

 Usage DOS:  LateChat port baud secs ansi firstname lastname [string to show]
 Usage OS/2: LateCht2 port baud secs ansi firstname lastname [string to show]

            port  =  DOS: com port being used  (1=com1 2=com2 etc)

                    Notice that the port number differs from those of
                    the fossil.  LateChat wants a 1 for Com1, 2 for Com2,
                    0 for local test, etc.  The fossil expects 0 for Com1,
                    1 for Com2, etc.  Keep this in mind if you use a batch
                    file to run latechat that diddles with the fossil.
                   
            port  =  OS/2: com port handle

                    In OS/2 you pass the opened handle to the comm
                    port, not the actual port number.


            baud  =  baud rate of caller as passed from board

                    As of version 1.01, 0 is passed to indicate that
                    the port is locked and LateChat should not attempt
                    to set the baudrate.  Otherwise, the board should
                    pass the regular values, such as 2400, 1200, 300, etc.

            seconds  =  time to give sysop to hit a key

                    This is how long the sysop thinks is the longest
                    time it would take him to get to the keyboard if he
                    is home when the user calls for a chat.

            ansi status  =  non-zero value if ansi active

                    This is the flag for ANSI from the BBS.  A zero
                    indicates no ANSI enabled for the caller, and
                    makes LateChat give the user a message. Usually a 1
                    means ANSI is enabled, though any non-zero will be
                    interpreted as ANSI turned on.

            [string to show]  =  string to display during paging

                    This parameter is optional.  If no string is given,
                    LateChat will provide "Paging Sysop ...".  If you
                    desire, any other string can be used, and is just
                    rolled out as entered on the command line.




 Keystrokes:
--------------------

    During chatting, the following keystrokes perform special functions.

        ctrl-R : Redraws screen, including the existing typing.
        ctrl-G : Bell.
        alt-J  : Jump to DOS (if memory permits).
        alt-H  : Hang up on caller.

    Alt keys are not passed over modems, so they are not available to the
    remote, but the ctrl key functions are available to the caller.



 Example calls:
--------------------

    (notice the fossil is left "hot" during shell by *H param)

    Sample Qbbs call for Com1 (type 7) and 12 second page:
        *H c:\qbbs\latechat.exe 1 *B 12 *G *F *L Hollering for sysop...

    Sample Qbbs call for Com2 and 14 second page with custom page message:
        *H c:\qbbs\latechat.exe 2 *B 12 *G *F *L Calling Joe Schmoe ...

    Sample Simplex call with auto port-picking and 15 sec page (type 240) :
        $* latechat $p $b 15 $a $f $l Paging Sysop...



 Miscellaneous Info:
---------------------

    You might recognize Chris's name as the person who wrote SIMPLEX BBS
    software for both DOS and OS/2, as well as several other goodies
    floating around in OS/2 utility file areas on BBSes.

    LateChat was originally conceived and written by Kelly Hughes for a
    BBS program that never got released.  The chat section was rewritten
    from the ground up to use the fossil, and we added the word-wrapping
    and special keystroke functions, and the result is LateChat.

    LateChat is released to the public domain and is free for anyone to
    use who finds it of interest. If you have questions, comments,
    postcards of praise, donations for releasing such a robust piece of
    interesting code to the public domain, or just want to say thanks,
    you may reach us at the following locations.  Any new versions of
    LateChat will be found on the boards we run.
